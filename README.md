# Number To Word - Indian

Javascript implemetation of http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23752/Convert-Number-to-Word

I was looking for a simple way to convert numbers to words in a website, the above codeproject article gave me the idea for an implementation.

the usage is : 
```js
toWords(number)       
       
```

# Limitations
Currently this is setup only to work with integer numbers, converting the same for decimals should not be much of an issue
